# Project-MQR
My Practical skills project, recess term 2017. 
MQR Makerere Quick Response is an android application that involves the use of a panic button to alert Security / Medical team members about urgent incidents.
Any Student can download and use the SOS app. No need for Sign Up
However Team members must Sign up with the app.
Button Sends Push notification containing short Message and a Google Maps Link containing location
